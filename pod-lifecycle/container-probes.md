The kubelet can optionally perform and react to three kinds of probes on running Containers:

**livenessProbe: **
Indicates whether the Container is running. If the liveness probe fails, the kubelet kills the Container, and the Container is subjected to its restart policy. If a Container does not provide a liveness probe, the default state is Success.

**readinessProbe:**
 Indicates whether the Container is ready to service requests. If the readiness probe fails, the endpoints controller removes the Podâ€™s IP address from the endpoints of all Services that match the Pod. The default state of readiness before the initial delay is Failure. If a Container does not provide a readiness probe, the default state is Success.

**startupProbe:**
 Indicates whether the application within the Container is started. All other probes are disabled if a startup probe is provided, until it succeeds. If the startup probe fails, the kubelet kills the Container, and the Container is subjected to its restart policy. If a Container does not provide a startup probe, the default state is Success.
