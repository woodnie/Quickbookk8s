A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod. As nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them. As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected. Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the Pods it created.

Some typical uses of a DaemonSet are:

    running a cluster storage daemon, such as glusterd, ceph, on each node.
    running a logs collection daemon on every node, such as fluentd or filebeat.
    running a node monitoring daemon on every node, such as Prometheus Node Exporter, Flowmill, Sysdig Agent, collectd, Dynatrace OneAgent, AppDynamics Agent, Datadog agent, New Relic agent, Ganglia gmond, Instana Agent or Elastic Metricbeat.

In a simple case, one DaemonSet, covering all nodes, would be used for each type of daemon. A more complex setup might use multiple DaemonSets for a single type of daemon, but with different flags and/or different memory and cpu requests for different hardware types.
